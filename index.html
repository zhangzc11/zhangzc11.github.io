                    I am a Chamberlain Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory working on experimental particle physics. 
                    <br>
                    I will join the Department of Engineering Physics at Tsinghua University as an Assistant Professor starting from Spring 2024.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My research focuses on solving the most mysterious puzzles in our understanding of fundamental matter and the interactions, such as the nature of dark matter, the origin of neutrino mass, the hierarchy problem, etc. 
                    <br>
                    To achieve such goals, I will work on developing innovative instruments and data analysis methods to look for unconventional signatures from new physics. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I envision myself to be both a physicist and an engineer, and I hope to build a leading team of scientists and engineers and instrumentation facilities at Tsinghua University.
                    <br>
